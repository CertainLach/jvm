```

## Roadmap

- pass test cases in JDK 
- WebAssembly, make the JVM work in Browser 
- separate class parser from project as one standalone create
- support thread
- support GC, then optimize System.arraycopy (the key of performance)
- split frame.rs into frame.rs & interp.rs
- pass TCK
- support higher version of JVM Spec 
- java options (-version, -server...)
